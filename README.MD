This is a repository to keep some useful scripts of mine. Feel free to contribute.

Enter the required values in order with a space between:

Start_Time Input_File Duration Output_File

Input_File / Output_File >> Use the backslash (\) for space
Example >> My\ File.mp4 will represent "My File.mp4"

Example>> 100, 60, 137...


##GCC Build and Run

".c file" "output file" "arg"
"arg" examples: -lm, -l...


##PERC

##YT-DLP Twitter Static
Change the {username} and {password} inside the file to fit your account.

Since Twitter is a jerk, it changes the accesibility all the time. Now we can access the files without an account again. Don't know how it will change in the future.
